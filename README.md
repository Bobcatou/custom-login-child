Custom login screen code to work with child theme 

I pulled this code from an article at Elegant Themes. https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-customize-the-wordpress-login-page

I changed the code in the functions file so it would work with a child theme and added some additional selectors in the css for the login page.
